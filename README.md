# Hedera

This is a minimalistic project that just has basic account features and a simple, static reader [or willâ€”this is a work in progress].

For the full Scaife Viewer running the Perseus Digital Library in production, see <https://github.com/scaife-viewer/scaife-viewer>.

## Getting Started

You'll need Redis running.  To get it going locally on the Mac, simply run:

```
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

```
npm install
pipenv run pip install pip==18.0
pipenv install
pipenv shell
createdb hedera
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py loaddata sites
./manage.py runserver
```

By default, the there is a background worker that will work syncronously (won't need the worker running to process the lemmatization).  If you want to process asyncronously locally:

```
export RQ_ASYNC=1
./manage.py runserver
```

Then in another terminal:

```
export RQ_ASYNC=1
./manage.py rqworker ${RQ_QUEUES:-default}
```

Leave the first Terminal window (above) running. Open a second Terminal window and run:

```
cd <path to hedera repo>
npm start
```

Browse to http://localhost:8000/ or http://localhost:8000/read/1/


You many want to sign up and activate an account on a local desktop/laptop. After signing up, you will see an error stating that the is not active. Since you probably won't be receiving an email, the easiest way to activate it is to run the following commands:

```
cd <path to hedera repo>
pipenv shell
./manage.py shell
```

In the shell, type:

```
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
user = User.objects.get(pk=1)
user.is_active = True
user.save()
```
