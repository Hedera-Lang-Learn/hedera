# Contributing to Hedera
We would love your contribution and input! Here we will outline ways to do the following:

- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), so all features and bugs fixes will happen via this method.
We welcome all pull request but ask you to conform to the following format:

1. Fork the repo and create a branch(e.g `fix/your-branch-name` or `feature/your-branch-name`) from `dev`
2. If your code is new/feature, please make sure you have tested and added test
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. precommit should have linted your code before you committed/pushed up your code
5. Create a pull request with any notes to the changes you made

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Githubs [issues](https://github.com/Hedera-Lang-Learn/hedera/issues)
Feel free to open up a new issue to report a new bug, please reference `bug_template.md` for template on bug reporting
